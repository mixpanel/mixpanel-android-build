/**
 * IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT
 *
 * In order to test the gradle plugin and compiler bits of this project, this gradle
 * file requires artifacts produced by the annotations and annotations-compiler projects,
 * but does not refer to those projects themselves. Artifacts should be uploaded with
 *
 * ./gradlew :annotations:uploadArchives :annotations-compiler:uploadArchives
 *
 * before this gradle file will even parse.
 *
 * This is circular, nasty, and requires human intervention to bootstrap, and there
 * may be a clever gradle way to deal with it. PATCHES TO THAT EFFECT ARE VERY WELCOME.
